What is Casa-Distro ?
---------------------

It's a distribution environment which helps to provide developers with a working development environment for BrainVisa and CATI tools.

It provides `Docker images <https://www.docker.com>`_ images compatible with BrainVisa distributions with all needed setup to build custom toolboxes, package them, and distribute them, in the same environment.
