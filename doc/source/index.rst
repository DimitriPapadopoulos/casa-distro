Overview
========

What is CASA ?
--------------

CASA = `CATI <http://cati-neuroimaging.com>`_ + `BrainVISA <http://brainvisa.info>`_

What is Casa-Distro ?
---------------------

It's a development environment which helps to provide developers with a working development environment for BrainVisa and CATI tools.

It provides `Docker images <https://www.docker.com>`_ images compatible with BrainVisa distributions with all needed setup to build custom toolboxes, package them, and distribute them, in the same environment.

Casa-distro is the metronome and swiss knife for the management of compilation and publication of CASA software distributions. It is a metronome because the distribution procedures, and especially the distribution frequency, is defined in casa-distro documentation (`bioproj wiki <https://bioproj.extra.cea.fr/redmine/projects/catidev/wiki/Casa-distro>`_). It is a swiss knife because it provides a tool for the management of the whole distro creation pipeline (configuration source retrieval, compilation, packaging, publication, etc.).
