What is Casa-Distro ?
---------------------

Casa-Distro is a cross-paltform ready-to-use environment which is used to install BranVisa and CATI environment. It avoids manual installation of required softwares and librairies.

This is possible by the use of virtualization technology to create a virtual applicance.

Casa-Distro supports a container technology, `Singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/>`_ and a virtual machine technology : `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.

To quickly and simply install the `BrainVISA software distribution <http://brainvisa.info>`_ through container images and an embedded casa-distro inside them, go to the :bv:`brainVisa download and install <download.html>` area.

If you are a developper looking for more details about casa-distro and its installation, you can follow the first steps here to install ``casa-distro``, but skip the ``casa_distro setup`` step, then follow the instructions in :doc:`developer`.
